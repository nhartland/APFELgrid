# APFELgrid
Code and examples for the APFELgrid plugin.

Requirements
------------
**APFEL** master
(github.com/scarrazza/apfel)

**LHAPDF** 6.X.X
(lhapdf.hepforge.org)

**APPLgrid** 1.4.70 
(applgrid.hepforge.org)

This must be modified such that all headers are installed
(simply copy all headers from /src/ to /appl_grid/ before installation of APPLgrid)

Installation and tests
----------------------
A bootstrap script is provided which downloads and installs the relevant APPLgrid headers,
detects the path of APFEL and configures and compiles the package for installation there.

To use this script and install to the default directory type

	./setup.sh
	make install

Alternatively, the APPLgrid headers may be installed manually as specified above, and the
installation performed in the typical autotools fashion

	(autoreconf -i)
	./configure
	make
	make install

A few tests can be performed upon the package with

	make check

this is automatically executed by the boostrap script.
